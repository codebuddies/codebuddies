                <p>Our community spends a lot of time helping each other on our <a href="https://codebuddies.slack.com">Slack chatroom</a>. To join, enter your email <a href="http://codebuddiesmeet.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                <h1>CodeBuddies Slack Etiquette for General Members</h1>
                  <div class="divider"></div>
                  <p>The following guidelines will help you get the most from our Slack community.</p>
                  <p>.</p>
                  <h2><img src="/images/logo-circle.png" style="width:50px;height:50px">Every member of CodeBuddies is a person</h2>
                    <p><b><i>This is a safe space.</i></b> No question is too "stupid", no topic too "basic".</p>
                    <p>.</p>
                    <p>This community is intended for self-directed learners, CS students, programming enthusiasts, and professional developers to
                      share knowledge and techniques. The admins, moderators, and everyone else in CodeBuddies <b><i>are donating their spare time;</i></b> 
                      nobody’s being paid. Our suggestions/answers may not always be correct, &amp; you may not always get an answer. Treat us like
                      somebody friendly you don’t know who’s standing next to you offering help or suggestions.</p>
                  <hr>
                  <h2><img src="/images/logo-circle.png" style="width:50px;height:50px">CodeBuddies is asynchronous &amp; international</h2>
                    <p>We have members on every continent (except Antartica), and many of us are working professionals. You may get help within
                      5 minutes if somebody who knows the answer is looking for something to do, but it’s entirely possible that you won’t get a 
                      response for an hour or day or more. If you’re asking about a less popular tool, or a specific edge case, you may even get 
                      an answer <b><i>several days later.</i></b></p>
                    <p>.</p>
                    <p>So remember to keep CodeBuddies open in the background for a while after asking a question - or check back periodically.</p>
                    <p>.</p>
                    <p>Please don't cross post the same question in multiple channels. People in this community may not be super-chatty at any given
                      moment, but we <i>are</i> reading posts across all channels. Someone will eventually see (and help) you.</p>
                  <hr>
                  <h2><img src="/images/logo-circle.png" style="width:50px;height:50px">Some channels are more active than others</h2>
                    <p>Questions in <b>#general</b> or <b>#advice</b> tend to get answered quickly, or they get pushed off the screen &amp; forgotten. We have a
                      handful of dedicated people that read the scrollback and try to answer forgotten questions, but there’s a lot of 
                      discussion/movement happening, you may want to re-post.</p>
                    <p>.</p>
                    <p>Conversely, if a channel is particluarly quiet, please do not post "this channel is quiet". Instead, try posting a 
                      question/article/or discussion point that others in the channel might comment on or enjoy.</p>
                  <hr>
                  <h2><img src="/images/logo-circle.png" style="width:50px;height:50px">Don’t “ask to ask”</h2>
                    <p>Newcomers very commonly ask about asking a question in one of a few ways.</p>
                    <p>.</p>
                    <h3>“DOES ANYONE KNOW ABOUT [X TOOL OR LIBRARY]?”</h3>
                      <p>The answer is probably “yes,” <b><i>but nobody can help you until you state what your problem is.</i></b> There are several questions to
                        this effect every week, and all too often by the time somebody asks what the <b>real</b> question is, the person who needed help has disconnected.</p>
                      <p>.</p>
                      <p><b><i>Please be specific with your questions so all of us can help you even when you aren't online.</i></b> Share a code snippet, a link
                        to where you're seeing the issue, a description of what is confusing you, and specifics on what you've tried so far. More 
                        often than not, it also helps to paste your error logs into a snippet or text file 
                        (<a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204145658-create-a-snippet">instructions here on how to do that in Slack</a>) 
                        to accompany your question/issue.</p>
                      <p>.</p>
                    <h3>“IS IT OKAY IF I ASK ABOUT [X TOOL OR LIBRARY] HERE?”</h3>
                      <p>We have a dizzying array of channels, which we’re aware of and for which we apologize. We have utility channels such as 
                        #announcements, #general, #advice, etc. All our channels are listed alphabetically.</p>
                      <p>.</p>
                      <p>Instead of asking, browse the Channels list for any that seem like obvious places to ask your question. If you don’t see any 
                        topics or Channels that fit, don’t hesitate to post it in <b>#general</b> or <b>#advice.</b> If there’s a better place for it, one of the 
                        moderators or other helpful users will suggest it, but don't worry - off topic messages aren’t going to get you banned.</p>
                  <hr>
                  <h2><img src="/images/logo-circle.png" style="width:50px;height:50px">Don’t ping / DM members unless it's directly relevant</h2>
                    <p>It’s very tempting to try to get more attention to your question by @-mentioning one of the high profile (or recently active) 
                      members, but please don’t. They may not actually be online, they may not be able to help, and <i>they may be in a completely 
                      different timezone</i> – nobody likes push notifications at 3 am from an impatient stranger.</p>
                    <p>.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, don’t DM other members without asking first. All of the same problems as @-mentioning apply, and <b><i>private 
                      conversations can’t help anyone else.</i></b> Your questions are likely not unique, and other people can learn from them when they’re 
                      asked in a public channel.</p>
                  <hr>
                  <h2><img src="/images/logo-circle.png" style="width:50px;height:50px">Be helpful</h2>
                    <p><b><i>We are a pay-it-forward community.</i></b> If someone here has helped you, please give back by helping someone else!</p>
                    <p>.</p>
                    <p>It doesn’t matter if you can’t answer a question in a brief sentence, or if you get pulled away before you can type out further 
                      replies. If a question isn’t clear, ask a clarifying question. If you remember something you read that seemed related, send a 
                      link. A lot of people who are stuck will be fine if you can’t provide the solution, they just need another place to look.</p>
                  <hr>
                  <h2><img src="/images/logo-circle.png" style="width:50px;height:50px">Be polite</h2>
                    <p>All the CodeBuddies here deserve your respect, so be polite. Not “retail employee” polite......but don’t fan flamewars, get 
                      sucked into lose-lose arguments, or other internet classics.</p>
                  <hr>
                  <h2><img src="/images/logo-circle.png" style="width:50px;height:50px">Be a model Slack citizen</h2>
                    <p>Be the change you want to see in the world! <i>Remember ours runs on volunteers and collaboration.</i> If a conversation is 
                      getting heated, try to defuse it. If a hard question is unanswered, dig in &amp; work through it with others. If a channel is full 
                      of unanswered questions, mention in <b>#codebuddies-meta</b> that you’d like to take ownership of it.</p>
                <hr>
                <hr>
                <p>Thanks to everyone who've been following these etiquette rules already! This community is <span style="color: blue; font-size: 20px"><i class="fas fa-globe-asia"></i></span> 
                  <b><i>international and distributed across timezones</i></b>, and it's nice to find that even with our diverse backgrounds, experience levels, and 
                  nationalities, we have similar goals and can support each other <span style="color: rgb(248, 121, 142); font-size: 20px"><i class="fas fa-heart"></i></span>. 
                  It's always a delight to be late-night coding – &amp; suddenly realize that halfway around the world, a cheerful hangout collaborator is pouring their first cup of coffee for the day.</p>

              <h3>How do you show your appreciation to someone on Slack?</h3>
                <p>We use a bot called plusplus to applaud or encourage each other. For example, if @hermionegranger gives me a helpful answer to a question I asked in a channel, I might type @hermionegranger++.
                  Think of these points as virtual cookies. <span style="font-size: 20px"><i class="far fa-smile-wink"></i></span></p>
              <h3>Who can create new channels on Slack?</h3>
                <p>Everyone can create private channels, but to minimize the number of inactive public channels (at one point we had over 100!), only admins can
                  create new public channels. If you'd like a new public channel to be created -- say, for a study group around a certain topic -- please request it
                  in the #codebuddies-meta channel.</p>
