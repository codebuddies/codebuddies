              What exactly is CodeBuddies?
            </h2>
            <p>
              We’re a community of independent code learners sharing knowledge and helping each other learn faster.
            </p>
            <p>
              We're 100% volunteer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our website, <a href="https://codebuddies.org/">codebuddies.org</a> is open-sourced and welcomes contributions on
              <a href="https://github.com/codebuddies/codebuddies">https://github.com/codebuddies/codebuddies</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              We come from all over the world. We're all different ages; we work and study across all sorts of professions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Everyone is welcome -- no previous experience required!
            </p>
            <p>
              This community thrives thanks to the generosity of our members, Slack admin moderators, GitHub code contributors, community mentors, and donations on 
              <a href="https://opencollective.com/codebuddies">https://opencollective.com/codebuddies</a>.  
            </p>
            <h2>Getting started</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>Please check your email. If you don't see an invite to the CodeBuddies Slack, please sign yourself up 
                <a href="https://codebuddiesmeet.herokuapp.com">here</a>.</li>
              <li>Don't be shy! Introduce yourself in the #introduce-yourself Slack channel, or on our forum at 
                <a href="https://forum.codebuddies.org/t/introduce-yourself-here/38/7">https://forum.codebuddies.org/t/introduce-yourself-here/38/7</a>, and welcome fellow new members.
                The more we know about each other, the better we can connect and collaborate. :)</li>
              <li>You'll automatically be invited to a couple of default Slack channels. You can browse all our public Slack 
                channels by clicking on the "Channels" link in the sidebar. Make sure to read our <a href="https://codebuddies.org/slack">CodeBuddies Slack 
                Etiquette for General Members</a>.</li>
              <li>Log into our website at <a href="https://codebuddies.org/">http://codebuddies.org</a> using your Github or new CodeBuddies Slack account 
                and take a look around -- or join a hangout! Hangouts are a way to study silently or pair program live with other members of the community. 
                There are three types of hangouts you can start: silent, teaching, or collaborative.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              When a hangout is scheduled, it'll get automatically posted back to our Slack #announcements channel.
            </p>
            <p>
              We've also got a <a href="https://codebuddies.org/coworking">24/7 silent coworking hangout</a> you can join at any time, without scheduling one.
            </p>
            <p>
              By default, our custom is to turn off video camera during these hangouts. Voice chat and screensharing (recommended) are optional.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you start a hangout we'll give you a way to meet on a CodeBuddies page by default, but you can also advertise an external hangout hosted on Twitch, Zoom, YouTube Livestream etc. if you prefer an alternative platform!
            </p>
            <p>
              PS Check out the <code>@cb_jarvis</code> command on Slack to schedule a hangout directly from Slack!
            </p>
            <ol start="5">
              <li>Interested in going deep on topics like functional javascript or that special ruby book or blockchain? 
                Start a study group on <a href="https://codebuddies.org/study-groups">codebuddies.org/study-groups</a>! All study groups created on the website are announced 
                on the #announcements channel in Slack, and as the owner of a group, you can also set up Slack channels to receive an alert when a hangout is scheduled in that group.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Study groups offer different tools to help connect people with similar learning goals, with the hope that they can motivate each other.
            </p>
            <ol start="6">
              <li>If you have any questions about the community or the project or want to talk to an admin, feel free to ask about it in the #codebuddies-meta Slack channel. 
                That’s also where discussions related to our community happen.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Happy learning!
            </p>
