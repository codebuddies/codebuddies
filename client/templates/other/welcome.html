            <p>
              We're 100% volunteer.
            </p>
            <p>
              This website is <a href="https://github.com/codebuddies/codebuddies">open-sourced</a> and welcomes contributors. As a not-for-profit, we are backed by our wonderful sponsors and donors on our

            <p>
              We come from all over the world. We're all different ages; we work and study across all sorts of professions.
            </p>

              </li>
              <li>When you join Slack, you'll automatically be invited to a couple of default Slack channels. You can browse all our public Slack
                channels by clicking on the "Channels" link in the sidebar. </li>
              <li>On this site, browse around. You can join a hangout -- or start your own! Hangouts are a way to study silently or pair program live with other members of the community.
                There are three types of hangouts you can start: silent, teaching, or collaborative.

              </li>
            <p>
              When a hangout is scheduled, it'll get automatically posted back to our Slack #announcements channel.
            </p>
            <p>
              By default, our custom is to turn off video camera during these hangouts. Voice chat and screensharing (recommended) are optional.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you start a hangout we'll give you a way to meet on a CodeBuddies page by default, but you can also advertise an external hangout hosted on Twitch, Zoom, YouTube Livestream etc. if you prefer an alternative platform!
            </p>
            <p>
              PS Type <code>@cb_jarvis</code> on Slack to schedule a hangout directly from Slack!
            </p>

              <li>Interested in going deep on topics like functional javascript or that special ruby book or blockchain?
                <a href="https://codebuddies.org/study-groups">Start a group</a>! All groups created on the website are automatically announced
                on the #announcements channel in Slack, and as the owner of the group, you can configure multiple settings, including setting up Slack channels to receive notifications whenever new hangouts are scheduled within your group.</li>

                              our <a href="https://codebuddies.org/silent">24/7 silent coworking</a> hangout at any time.
